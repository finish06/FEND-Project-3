## Game Mechanics

The objective is to successfully move the player through the grass and stones to the opposite side of the map, i.e. the water, without contacting a giant bug. Player movement is accomplished by the keyboard arrow keys. The player can move up, down, left and right within the boundaries of the screen. Upon reaching the water, the player will be reset to his original location for another round of fun!
